**Introduction**

This repository contains the projects and exercises I completed during my core Java training. It includes various Java programs that demonstrate key concepts and features of 
the Java programming language.

__Core Java encompasses the fundamental aspects of the Java programming language. Here are some key features:__

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

Java is an object-oriented language that supports concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

**Platform Independence:**

Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java platform-independent or "write once, run anywhere" (WORA).

**Simple and Easy to Learn:**

Java has a straightforward syntax that is easy to understand and learn, especially for those familiar with C or C++.

**Secure:**

Java provides a secure environment for developing applications. It includes a security manager that defines access rules for classes and has a robust exception-handling mechanism.

**Robust and Reliable:**

Java emphasizes early checking for possible errors, runtime checking, and exception handling, making it a robust language. Its automatic garbage collection helps in memory management, reducing the risk of memory leaks.
